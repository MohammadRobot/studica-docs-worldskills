Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the ROS library for the Studica robot platform, allowing ROS functionality for a variety of Studica's hardware. Compared to the current codebase this directly uses the VMXPi HAL, more information on the VMXPi HAL API can be found at `VMX-pi C++ HAL <https://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/vmx-pi/apidocs/hal_cpp/html/class_v_m_x_pi.html>`__.

To see indepth examples of the VMXPi HAL, your RPi has a lot in the ``/usr/local/src/vmxpi/`` directory.
